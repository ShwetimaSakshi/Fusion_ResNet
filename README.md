## SUMMARY
This project implements a Fusion model combining Multi-Pathway ResNeXt and Wide ResNet architectures for image classification tasks. The Wide ResNet component, with a depth of 28 and width of 10, integrates with ResNeXt's multi-pathway blocks to enhance feature extraction capabilities. Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization and strategic dropout rates mitigate overfitting. Batch normalization and ReLU activation further stabilize training and introduce non-linearity. Data augmentation methods like random cropping, flipping, and erasing augment the CIFAR-10 dataset, enhancing model robustness. Through extensive experiments with varying hyperparameters and optimizers (Adam, Adamax, RMSprop), the model achieved up to 93.36% accuracy, demonstrating effective performance optimization and generalization capabilities.
